## 🏛️ Technical Architecture (The Engine)
Fard is built using **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles, ensuring the codebase is modular, maintainable, and 100% testable.

### The Three Layers:
1.  **Presentation Layer (UI & Logic)**:
    *   **Bloc Pattern**: Decouples UI from business logic using `flutter_bloc` and `bloc_concurrency`.
    *   **Theme Extensions**: Custom design tokens for specialized Islamic aesthetics (Emerald & Gold).
2.  **Domain Layer (Pure Business Logic - DDD)**:
    *   **Entities**: Immutable models generated with **Freezed** for robust state handling.
    *   **Use Cases**: Explicit orchestrators of business rules (e.g., `AddMissedPrayer`, `GetSurah`).
    *   **Repository Interfaces**: Pure abstractions defining the "what" without the "how".
3.  **Data Layer (Infrastructure)**:
    *   **Dependency Injection**: Automated service registration using **Get_It** and **Injectable**.
    *   **Offline-First Persistence**: High-concurrency data access via **Hive CE** (NoSQL).
    *   **Mappers**: Seamless transformation between Data Models (DTOs) and Domain Entities.
